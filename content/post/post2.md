## Annual Letter - 1 (2023), Personal Reflection for Education and Career (Overview)
After reading the annual letter from a friend of mine who has kept writing for a couple of consecutive years, I realized that I should quickly jump on this too.

### Why writing reflections or personal annual letters?
As time goes by, personally I became more reflective, and often found myself lingering in my own head and trying to remember what I was in the past. For me, this helps me keep reminding myself of where I come from and why I'm where I am today so that I could make better decsion for my future. I believe some people might have the same kind of mechanism and thought process to keep their own thoughts organized.
In addtion, I think personally I have changed a lot comparing to couple years ago due to graduation, work, and the environmental changes in my life. Therefore, I often try to remember who I was in the old days to think beyond. Or this is also a good way to escape the roles I am playing from my family, work, or even the society, to really get back to my true self, and reflect on my life goals, who I am, and what impact I am trying to achieve before I die as a human being. Not controlled by anybody or anything else, purely from within. But something my thoughts gets a little messy, and stuck in the chaos of time. Therefore, I think it is a great way to write them down periodically, kind of like a document to help me organize everything. This is why I am starting this Annual Letter thing.
